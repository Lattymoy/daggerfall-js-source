# World-Arc (ACTIVE)

Assemble Daggerfall's world from decoded data onto our WebGL2 stack.
Data math is ported 1:1 from DFU (MeshReader.cs geometry paths, RMBLayout.cs);
rendering is ours per Port-Doctrine.

## Milestone 4 - building interiors + doors (SHIPPED)

ModelDoor extraction runs inside meshReader's vertex pass, verbatim DFU
LoadVertices: door archives 74 (building), 56 (dungeon enter), 331 (ruin
enter, record 0 is plain stone and skipped), 95 (dungeon exit); archives
> 100 reduce to base (archive - trunc(archive/100)*100) for the check except
331/156 (156 only exempts the reduction, never a door itself); each plane of
a door submesh is one door, Index resets per submesh; Normal =
normalize(cross(v0-v2, v0-v1)). Corpus pins: 1999 doors on 1398 of the 10251
models (1712 building / 285 dungeon-enter / 2 exit).
`src/world/staticDoors.js` ports GameObjectHelper.GetStaticDoors 1:1
(size from the v0/v2 diagonal, thickness = max(width, depth), centre/normal
kept in model space with the placement matrix riding along).

`src/world/interiorLayout.js` ports DaggerfallInterior's geometry paths:
AddModels (prop type 3 keeps +Y unnegated then anchors to the model's lowest
vertex Y; IsBadInteriorModel's 27-block repair table filters misplaced model
31000), AddFlats (editor archive 199 kept as markers, hidden from render
exactly as DFU spawns-then-hides; INTERIOR_MARKER enum Rest 4 / Enter 8 /
Treasure 19 / LadderBottom 21 / LadderTop 22), AddActionDoors (model
9000 + DoorModelIndex % 5, placed closed, openRotation carried for the
Player arc). Static door triggers accumulate from every placed model.
Corpus: all 6832 building interiors across 920 RMBs lay out clean - 226208
placements, 11449 static doors, 39940 rendered flats, exactly 60 model-31000
instances filtered (one per flagged block/record combo). Scene:
`?interior=<BLOCK>:<record>` (e.g. MAGEAA00.RMB:0), camera at the Enter
marker facing the interior bounding center; `SHOT_QUERY` drives the shot
tool at any scene. Routed onward: people flats (Characters), furniture
actions / loot / spawn points (Systems), point lights (Rendering), ladder +
door behavior (Player). Pins in test/interior.test.js.

## Milestone 3 - flats and billboards (SHIPPED)

Every RMB flat path from RMBLayout, verbatim: misc block flats (lights
billboards included; point-light components later), exterior subrecord flats
with the UNROTATED (subX, 0, -subZ) offset DFU uses, editor archive 199
skipped, nature-range archives (500-511) swapped to the climate nature
archive - including DFU's `billboardPosition.z = natureFlatsOffsetY` raw -2
assignment, a suspected upstream y/z typo kept verbatim for parity (no
visible artifact in Daggerfall city; revisit against DFU side-by-side).
Ground scenery reads [x][15-y], records < 1 skipped. Billboard size =
(size + trunc(size * scale / 256)) * GlobalScale, bottom-anchored
(AlignToBase = +h/2). Renderer: cylindrical (Y-locked) billboards expanded
in the vertex shader along camera right, batched per (archive, record).
Daggerfall city: 897 flats in 80 batches - street lanterns, shop signs,
trees, shrubs. `src/world/rmbFlats.js`, `src/render/renderer.js` billboard
path. NPC faction metadata and animal sounds queued with their systems.

## Milestone 2 - full location render (SHIPPED)

Complete exteriors assembled from MAPS location data: block grid resolved via
checkName(getRmbBlockName(x, y)), block (x, y) placed at (x * RMBSide, 0,
y * RMBSide) with RMBSide 102.4, no row inversion - verbatim
DaggerfallLocation.LayoutLocation. Ground archive driven by the location
climate (Daggerfall city -> Woodlands 302). Scene selectable with
?region=&loc=. Daggerfall city: 64 blocks, 1109 placements, 202 unique
meshes, 181 textures, meshes and textures shared across blocks, per-block
ground meshes, origin folded into each placement matrix.
`src/world/locationLayout.js`, pins in test/world.test.js.

## Milestone 1 - single RMB block render (SHIPPED)

MAGEAA00.RMB assembled and rendered from original data: BLOCKS placement ->
ARCH3D geometry -> TEXTURE archives via ART_PAL. 20 placements, 7 unique
meshes, 35 textures. Proven by headless screenshot (`npm run shot`).

Modules:
- `src/world/mat4.js` - column-major mat4; TRS matches Unity
  Matrix4x4.TRS/Quaternion.Euler (R = Ry * Rx * Rz, degrees), parent * child.
- `src/world/meshReader.js` - DFMesh -> GPU buffers. Verbatim: GlobalScale
  0.025, position (X, -Y, Z) * scale, normal normalize(NX, -NY, NZ),
  uv (U/texW, -(V/texH)) relying on REPEAT wrap, fan indices
  [shared, vc+1, vc].
- `src/world/rmbLayout.js` - verbatim placement: subrecord
  T(XPos, 0, 4096 - ZPos) * R(0, -YRot/5.6889, 0); building model =
  subrecordMatrix * TRS((X, -Y, Z), euler(-rot)/div); misc models with
  propsOffsetY -4 and Z + 4096; ground tiles GroundTiles[x][15 - y] with
  records >= 56 reset to grass 8. Classic data never sets model scale (fields
  are mod-injection only) so scale is identity.
- `src/render/renderer.js` - WebGL2: REPEAT + NEAREST textures uploaded
  bottom-up as getColor32 emits them, alpha < 0.5 discard, directional light.
- `src/render/groundMesh.js` - 16x16 tile quads at GroundOffset (-1), batched
  per record, rotate/flip as UV transforms. DFU uses a tilemap-shader atlas;
  per-tile quads are our renderer-side equivalent.
- `src/main.js` - loads /arena2/* (dev-only vite middleware in
  vite.config.js; data never bundled), assembles the block, fly camera
  (click to lock, WASD + mouse, Shift speed), ?shot fixed vantage.
- `tools/screenshot.mjs` - in-process vite + Playwright chromium
  (PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/opt/pw-browsers, playwright@1.56.0 pinned to the
  provisioned chromium-1194). Waits for window.__shotReady.

Numeric anchors (test/world.test.js): model 456 p0 (-9.6, 0, 12.8),
uv0 (0, -2), fan [0,2,1,0,3,2]; MAGEAA00 model 0 world origin (48.2, 0, 25.4)
via T(48, 0, 25.6) * Ry(-270deg).

## Queue (in order, one at a time)

1. RDB dungeon layout (RDBLayout.cs) with action records.
2. Terrain: WOODS.WLD heightmap reader + streaming world.

## Testing

Real-data pins live in `test/world.test.js`. Screenshot harness is manual
proof, not a suite gate (needs ARENA2 + chromium).
