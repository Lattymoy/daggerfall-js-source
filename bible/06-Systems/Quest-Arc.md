# Quest-Arc (ACTIVE)

The quest machine - DFU's Questing subsystem ported 1:1 against the
vendored quest pack. Sourcing DECIDED at Q1 (route (a), Mac 2026-08-20,
"lock in and start the quest system"): DFU ships quests as decompiled
`.txt` sources its parser reads - classic's QBN/QRC binaries are a form
DFU itself never parses - so the pack (265 quests + the quest tables)
is vendored at `vendor/dfu-quests` (MIT, provenance-pinned README).
That makes the quest corpus gate the first that runs with NO ARENA2 and
no network anywhere.

## Q1 - THE PARSE LAYER (SHIPPED 2026-08-20)

`src/systems/quest/`, all DFU sources named per file:

- `table.js` - Utility/Table.cs whole: schema/comment/inline-comment/
  string-literal parsing, GetInt's TryParse -1, duplicate keys warn and
  keep the FIRST row.
- `symbol.js` - Symbol.cs + GetInnerSymbolName (wrappers trimmed
  outside in; inner `_` survives: `_one_day_` -> `one_day`).
- `tables.js` - the QuestMachine.Instance table properties as a module
  singleton until Q2 ships the machine; unset tables THROW BY NAME.
- `message.js` - Message.cs: `<ce>` centring (whole-line trim vs
  end-trim), `<--->` variants, Text+formatting token pairs. Macro
  expansion pends the macro slice; the random variant draw is an
  injectable uniform roll (Ledger A engine-PRNG rule).
- `parser.js` - Parser.cs whole: header/QRC/QBN split, fixed message
  types taking ids FROM Quests-StaticMessages, PeekMessageEnd's
  forgotten-blank-line forgiveness, QBN dispatch on the RAW line's
  leading word, global-var link tasks via Quests-GlobalVars, the FIRST
  unrecognized block as the headless startup task and a second one
  throwing, ReadBlock's tab-only trim. Statics (SplitLine/SplitField/
  ParseInt) live here as in the C#.
- `task.js` - Task.cs parse half: Standard/PersistUntil/Variable/
  GlobalVarLink/Headless (NextUID symbol, starts triggered). Body
  lines land in `pendingActionLines` until Q2's action registry
  exists (`setActionFactory` is the seam) - the honest stand-in for
  DFU's per-line "Action not found" log noise, and the Q2 work queue.
- `quest.js` - Quest.cs structure half: uid allocator, the three
  collections with DFU's add semantics (duplicate message/resource
  THROW, duplicate task symbol MERGES actions).
- `clock.js` / `foe.js` / `place.js` / `person.js` / `item.js` - the
  five resource declarations. Clock carries the verbatim time math
  (`.` in the time regex is ANY CHARACTER, bug-for-bug) and the
  flag&16 / flag&1-hack travel arm as `travelTimePending` until Q3
  binds Places; Foe resolves Quests-Foes to a MobileTypes id and
  clamps count 1..8; Place resolves Quests-Places p1/p2/p3
  (CustomParseInt hex) and keeps DFU's invalid-placeType throw, site
  binding pending; Person parses the identification ladder and throws
  where DFU throws; Item parses the five declaration shapes + range.

REGEX NOTE: C# alternations reuse group names across alternatives;
this Node cannot. Multi-alternative patterns are ordered lists through
`matchFirst`, which keeps .NET semantics (leftmost position wins, ties
to pattern order).

Gate: `test/quest.test.js` - all 265 vendored quests parse; M0B00Y16
pinned deep (20 messages, fixed ids from the table, 2 rumour variants,
the 11-resource roster with table-resolved values, 27 tasks - 1
headless triggered, 5 variables); Clock range draws seeded; the DFU
failure modes throw verbatim.

## Q2 - THE MACHINE CORE (SHIPPED 2026-08-20)

- `machine.js` - QuestMachine.cs: the live quest table, the
  brute-force GetActionTemplate registry, scheduled-invoke queue, and
  the tick (invoke -> update -> tombstone -> one-week expiry at 604800
  classic seconds). DFU ticks at 10Hz REAL time while clocks ride
  WORLD time: the host paces tick() by TICKS_PER_SECOND and injects
  nowSeconds. The 64 globals (SAVEVARS.DAT state) live on the machine
  and reach GlobalVarLink tasks through quest.hooks.
- `quest.js` grew the lifecycle half: the Update loop verbatim
  (ticksToEnd countdown, resource Tick, task loop with questBreak
  bail and pending popups between tasks, PostTick), EndQuest's
  two-tick grace + faction rep hook (5/-2), log steps 0-9,
  ShowMessagePopup's oncePerQuest/immediate law, the tombstone.
  Popup DELIVERY is the machine's showPopup hook - the parchment box
  and its 22-line chunking are Q4's UI wiring.
- `task.js` grew Update: the trigger law whole - the FIRST always-on
  trigger is PRIMARY (starts AND stops, S0000977), later ones
  SECONDARY (start only, W0C00Y00); PersistUntil checks its target
  after at least one tick and REARMS while unset (S0000011).
- `clock.js` grew the tick half: whole-second world-time deltas,
  TriggerTask starting the same-named task, StartTimer's "_2place_"
  one-way-trip arm riding the Q3 travel seam (pending loudly).
- `actions.js` - ActionTemplate + the ten world-free actions 1:1
  (StartTask/setvar, ClearTask, UnsetTask, EndQuest, WhenTask with
  DFU's exact eval short-circuits, StartStopTimer, Say, LogMessage,
  RemoveLogMessage, PickOneOf on the quest's injectable roll).

Gate: `test/questmachine.test.js` - a crafted quest end to end
(clock -> questBreak -> two-tick end -> tombstone -> expiry), the
WhenTask law, seeded PickOneOf, permanent drops, the globals store,
and THE COVERAGE PIN: the tranche resolves exactly 3347 of 7235
corpus action lines (46.3%) - each action slice must move it UP.

## QUEST AUDIT I (2026-08-20, pre-merge)

Three lanes: DFU parity line-by-line, JS correctness + vendor
integrity, and a 27-mutation campaign. Everything found is FIXED or
recorded; the corpus gate and all pins stayed green after.

- MUTATIONS: 17/27 killed at first run; every survivor was an
  unpinned law and now has a pin (11 added - header brackets, symbol
  law, <ce> trim, PersistUntil start, secondary always-on, questBreak
  mid-task, oncePerQuest, clock truncation, week expiry, duplicate-
  task merge, popup LIFO). No mutation was killed only by the
  coverage numbers.
- PARITY HIGH 1: Task.SetTriggerValue's REARM-ON-CLEAR was missing -
  a cleared-then-restarted task ran zero actions the second time
  ("clear" exists exactly so tasks re-trigger). Fixed + pinned.
- PARITY HIGH 2: the registry is first-match-wins over UNANCHORED
  patterns, and DFU registers the un-ported When*/Clicked* triggers
  BEFORE the tranche - so Say hijacked "clicked npc _x_ say 1011" (27
  corpus lines) into an unconditional popup and WhenTask built bogus
  evals from "when repute with ..." (S0000999!). GUARDS now stand at
  the C# registry positions and send those lines to
  pendingActionLines; the registry adopted C#'s relative order; the
  coverage pin moved 3347->3297 (the 50 protected lines) and is
  documented as the honest number.
- CORRECTNESS HIGH: the parser<->resource import cycle closed through
  an eval-time `extends` - 7 of 15 modules crashed if imported first;
  Parser statics moved to leaf parseUtils.js, every module now
  imports standalone.
- Also fixed: the action factory rides the parse (was a module global
  owned by the last-constructed machine); machine error-termination
  with the protected-quest spine (S0000999/S0000977/_BRISIEN);
  tombstone completes the quest; C# disposal order; Person atHome
  last-option-wins; symbol Trim nets to '_' alone (the C# DEAD
  Trim('=')/Trim('#') assignments replicated bug-for-bug + repinned);
  popup empty-token early-out; Table dup-column throw, int.TryParse
  sign/int32 surface, index-overload loud throw; parseInt '+'/int32;
  customParseInt malformed-hex throw; TrimEnd('\r') strips all;
  token struct-copies; PersistUntil missing target throws (C# NRE ->
  error termination); a pending-travel clock is HELD, never an
  instant 0s fire. Vendor pack verified byte-identical to upstream
  (265+11 files), no .meta, no ARENA2-shaped content.
- KEPT (recorded, not fixed): getTextTokens' explicit-variant-
  answers-0 quirk (Message.cs:161); WhenTask's Contains-ladder
  operator misclassification; Person's whole-line options scan.

## Queue

- **Q2b - MORE ACTIONS**: the remaining 73 Actions/*.cs in
  coverage-ordered slices (the pin names the backlog); the
  QuestListsManager over the vendored QuestList tables.
- **Q3 - WORLD BINDING**: Place SetupLocalSite/SetupRemoteSite/
  SetupFixedLocation against the port's world data, the Person
  Setup*NPC chain against FACTION.TXT, SiteLinks + QuestMarkers,
  Foe spawning through the host enemy seams, Clock travel time
  (2.5x cautious, the F-slice calculator).
- **Q4 - SURFACES**: the offer flow (guild questors + TalkManager
  rumours), the journal/log UI, quest items through the inventory,
  the quest save envelope.
