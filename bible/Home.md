# project-dagger

A 1:1 JavaScript port of Daggerfall, built the way we build: hand-rolled WebGL2, Vite, Node ESM, no framework. Data layer and game logic ported faithfully from Daggerfall Unity's reverse-engineered C#; presentation rebuilt on our stack; characters rebuilt on our voxel system.

Read `01-Overview/Port-Doctrine.md` before touching anything.

## Process

Doc edits are part of the change: every scripted bible edit must ASSERT
the needle matched (a silent `.replace` no-op shipped a stale
Rendering.md queue in the M6 audit and was only caught in the M7 audit).
Verify doc diffs in `git diff` before committing, same as code.

## Sections

- `01-Overview/` - vision, port doctrine, phase plan, Port-Ledger (departures/quirks/unported)
- `02-Formats/` - binary format readers (BSA, TEXTURE, IMG/CIF, ARCH3D, BLOCKS, MAPS, SND)
- `03-World/` - block assembly, terrain, location layout, streaming
- `04-Characters/` - voxel rigs, paperdoll-as-outfits, NPCs
- `05-Combat/` - FormulaHelper port, weapons, hit resolution
- `06-Systems/` - quests, items, magic, guilds, calendar, save format
- `07-Rendering/` - WebGL2 renderer, palettes, lighting, sky
- `08-Audio/` - music (HMI/XMI), sound effects, audio state machine
- `09-Testing/` - test doctrine, harnesses, data validation
- `10-UI/` - HUD, menus, native Daggerfall UI reproduction

## Active arcs

- `02-Formats/Readers-Arc.md` - COMPLETE. All 8 format readers shipped with corpus gates.
- `03-World/World-Arc.md` - ACTIVE. Milestone 7 shipped: locations on terrain (?world). Queue: floating-origin streaming + nature flats.

## Ground rules carried from project-final

- Desktop-only. No touch controls, no mobile layout.
- Bible is flat under `bible/`. This file is the index. No Dashboard.md.
- Prototype HTMLs at repo root must register in `vite.config.js` rollupOptions.input.
- One feature at a time. Grep first. str_replace over rewrites.
