# project-dagger

A 1:1 JavaScript port of Daggerfall, built the way we build: hand-rolled WebGL2, Vite, Node ESM, no framework. Data layer and game logic ported faithfully from Daggerfall Unity's reverse-engineered C#; presentation rebuilt on our stack; characters rebuilt on our voxel system.

Read `01-Overview/Port-Doctrine.md` before touching anything.

## Process

Doc edits are part of the change: every scripted bible edit must ASSERT
the needle matched (a silent `.replace` no-op shipped a stale
Rendering.md queue in the M6 audit and was only caught in the M7 audit).
Verify doc diffs in `git diff` before committing, same as code.
Sprite-orientation checks must compare close-up render crops against
the raw record art - a distant screenshot passed a vertically flipped
billboard shader for six milestones (caught by Mac after M8).
Playwright probes of the live frame loop must frame-sync on the
shot-mode __frame counter, never sleep - SwiftShader renders the
streaming scene at seconds per frame, so sleeps sample stale state
(M9 audit probe initially reported zero crossings for a real flight).
Unity asset values (prefab lights, AnimationCurve keys) are groundable
without widening the sparse clone: git show HEAD:Assets/Prefabs/....prefab
reads the YAML from the object store (used to verify the R5 constants).
When a renderer change diffs against a baseline and theory stalls,
build a screen-projection ground-truth probe: rebuild the scene's data
+ exact camera in Node, project known world points to screen, and read
the framebuffer pixels - single far pixels are rounding-limited, so
verify laws on NEAR tiles (a shot-mode override hook can force test
bytes). The R9 HLSL-row-major/GLSL-column-major transpose was only
provable this way. But probes verify what they sample: R9 initially
shipped with every building missing because the probes only ever read
terrain fragments - when a diff spans a large frame fraction, check
full-frame composition (every draw pass still present?) before
explaining the diff away. Draw entry points must own their program
binding; interleaving a new pass exposed drawMesh's assumption.

## Sections

- `01-Overview/` - vision, port doctrine, phase plan, Port-Ledger (departures/quirks/unported)
- `02-Formats/` - binary format readers (BSA, TEXTURE, IMG/CIF, ARCH3D, BLOCKS, MAPS, SND, SKY)
- `03-World/` - block assembly, terrain, location layout, streaming
- `04-Characters/` - voxel rigs, paperdoll-as-outfits, NPCs
- `05-Combat/` - FormulaHelper port, weapons, hit resolution
- `06-Systems/` - quests, items, magic, guilds, calendar, save format
- `07-Rendering/` - WebGL2 renderer, palettes, lighting, sky
- `08-Audio/` - music (HMI/XMI), sound effects, audio state machine
- `09-Testing/` - test doctrine, harnesses, data validation
- `10-UI/` - HUD, menus, native Daggerfall UI reproduction

## Active arcs

- `02-Formats/Readers-Arc.md` - COMPLETE. All 8 format readers shipped with corpus gates.
- `03-World/World-Arc.md` - COMPLETE. Milestone 9 shipped: floating-origin streaming world (?world). Build queue empty.
- `04-Characters/Characters-Arc.md` - ACTIVE. Combat layer COMPLETE + audited (zero open gates: FP swing clips, projectile arrows, hit reactions all shipped). Engine-world integration slices 1-5 shipped: animate.js extracted renderer-agnostic, engineRig canonical in the raw-GL engine, grounded via the LIVE support point, the 9x character pass (world excluded), and the interior loco migrated onto createCharacterRig/IDLE (inline copy deleted). NEXT: world camera modes. See the Current State section atop the arc.
- `03-World/Player-Arc.md` - COMPLETE. Walk, collide, activate, transition: movement/collision (P1), activation + action chains (P2), interior/dungeon transitions (P3/P5), swing doors (P4), ladders (P6), scene consolidation onto worldModes + dataPipeline (P7), and interiors parented in the building world frame with one-frame landings (P8). Next arc decision pending.
- `07-Rendering/Rendering-Arc.md` - R13 shipped: precipitation + verbatim storm lightning. Queue empty except spectral emission (blocked on Characters). Next arc decision: Player.

## Repo layout

`src/main.js` is a thin scene router (37 lines). Scenes live in
`src/scenes/` (exterior, interior, dungeon, terrain, world) with shared
helpers in `src/scenes/shared.js`; each file carries its milestone header.
Data readers in `src/formats/`, world assembly in `src/world/`, GL in
`src/render/`. Extraction verified pixel-identical across all five scenes.

## Ground rules carried from project-final

- Desktop-only. No touch controls, no mobile layout.
- Bible is flat under `bible/`. This file is the index. No Dashboard.md.
- Prototype HTMLs at repo root must register in `vite.config.js` rollupOptions.input.
- One feature at a time. Grep first. str_replace over rewrites.
