# Audio

Sound effects: DAGGER.SND reader COMPLETE (`src/formats/sndFile.js`, 459
sounds, byte-exact RIFF headers) - see Readers-Arc.

A1 (2026-08-14) SHIPPED - runtime playback: `src/systems/audio.js`
(WebAudio engine - Ledger A row; lazy 8-bit PCM -> AudioBuffer,
PannerNode 3D with the camera as listener, gesture-gated context for
mobile) + `src/systems/soundClips.js` (the consumed SoundClips subset,
indices verbatim; GetSwingSound pitch table; PlayHitSound families).
Consumers live in the dungeon: door open/close (DungeonDoor clips on
the ActionSystem onDoorState seam), player swing on Strike-state
entry (FPSWeapon shape), landed hits at the struck foe / whiffs
(Hit2/Parry6), the player taking hits (PlayerFootsteps families),
enemy attack sounds (50%, humans silent), and the EnemySounds attract
loop verbatim (radius 16, delay Range(3,10) always stepping, 80/20
bark/move, humans silent). Enemy Move/Bark/AttackSound columns
restored into enemyBasics.js via the generator (C3 parity asserted,
61/62 rows carry sounds).

Music: HMI/XMI in MIDI.BSA has NO DFU reader (Unity synthesizes music); the
playback strategy is this arc's first decision (approved routing, see
Port-Ledger A). Also owned here: animal audio sources on flats, torch burning
sounds on dungeon flats (RDBLayout.AddTorchAudioSource) and action sounds
(action.index carries the sound id), the audio state machine, and iOS
AudioContext.resume discipline when a shell exists.
