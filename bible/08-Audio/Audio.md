# Audio

Sound effects: DAGGER.SND reader COMPLETE (`src/formats/sndFile.js`, 459
sounds, byte-exact RIFF headers) - see Readers-Arc.

A1 (2026-08-14) SHIPPED - runtime playback: `src/systems/audio.js`
(WebAudio engine - Ledger A row; lazy 8-bit PCM -> AudioBuffer,
PannerNode 3D with the camera as listener, gesture-gated context for
mobile) + `src/systems/soundClips.js` (the consumed SoundClips subset,
indices verbatim; GetSwingSound pitch table; PlayHitSound families).
Consumers live in the dungeon: door open/close (DungeonDoor clips on
the ActionSystem onDoorState seam), player swing on Strike-state
entry (FPSWeapon shape), landed hits at the struck foe / whiffs
(Hit2/Parry6), the player taking hits (PlayerFootsteps families),
enemy attack sounds (50%, humans silent), and the EnemySounds attract
loop verbatim (radius 16, delay Range(3,10) always stepping, 80/20
bark/move, humans silent). Enemy Move/Bark/AttackSound columns
restored into enemyBasics.js via the generator (C3 parity asserted,
61/62 rows carry sounds).

Music: HMI/XMI in MIDI.BSA has NO DFU reader (Unity synthesizes music); the
playback strategy is this arc's first decision (approved routing, see
Port-Ledger A). Also owned here: animal audio sources on flats, torch burning
sounds on dungeon flats (RDBLayout.AddTorchAudioSource) and action sounds
(action.index carries the sound id), the audio state machine, and iOS
AudioContext.resume discipline when a shell exists.

## A2 (action + ambient sources): SHIPPED (2026-08-16)

The Ledger C rows "Torch audio sources", "Animal audio sources", and
the action-PlaySound half of "Transition + activation sounds".
Verbatim from RDBLayout/GameObjectHelper/DaggerfallAudioSource/
DaggerfallAction:

- **Action sounds**: DaggerfallAction.Play plays the RDB soundIndex
  (action.index > 0) on EVERY Play, movers and effect actions alike -
  the ActionSystem grew an onActionSound seam; the scene speaks from
  the mover's live matrix or the effect object's origin through the
  default min1/max500 3D profile. (The soundIndex doubles as data on
  some flags - Hurt21's damage bound, CastSpell's spell id - and DFU
  plays those as sounds too; preserved.)
- **Torches** (RDBLayout.AddTorchAudioSource + IsTorchFlat): lights
  archive 210 records {0,1,6,16,17,18,19,20} loop Burning (420) with
  LINEAR rolloff at maxDistance 5 and volume 0.7 ("or the burning
  sound is audible almost everywhere"). LoopIfPlayerNear: the engine
  grew loop3d (linear panner + stop handle); the scene keeps a live
  source ONLY while the player is inside 5m, so a torch-heavy dungeon
  carries no idle nodes. Sources free on context destroy.
- **Animals** (GameObjectHelper.AddAnimalAudioSource): archive 201
  flats - records 0/1 horse (99), 3/4 cow (103), 5/6 pig (102),
  7/8 cat (101), 9/10 dog (100), gap records silent - at maxDistance
  768*GlobalScale = 19.2. PlayRandomlyIfPlayerNear verbatim: per
  CLASSIC UPDATE in range, DFRandom.rand() <= 100 plays (~once per
  ~20s of proximity).
- **Scope (honest)**: dungeon scene only - the exterior/interior
  scenes carry no audio engine wiring yet (their RMB animals/torches
  join when audio reaches those scenes; rows stay in Ledger C).
  Ladder-climb and enter/exit stingers ride the interior transition
  seams (P6/P7) - same routing. Music (HMI/XMI) still pends its
  strategy decision.

2 tests (audio.test.js 4 -> 6). Suite 310/75, ARENA2 corpus 310/310
green pre-commit.

### A2 audit note (2026-08-16c): the bash sound lands

AttemptBash's onDoorBash seam (routed by the bash slice before A2's
engine existed) is now wired: PlayerDoorBash (7) plays from the door
through the standard 3D profile on every bash attempt, open or
closed, exactly where DFU's DaggerfallAudioSource sits.
